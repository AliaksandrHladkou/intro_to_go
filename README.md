# intro_to_go
Golang Examination and Comparison 
Spring 2019
##Description
Go is well-known programming language for its speed in both execution and compilation. This language is used in many popular applications such as YouTube, Google, SoundCloud, Docker, etc. There are many prospects/features of choosing programming language such as Go. First of all, it does not require any Virtual Machines which means that it does not require interpreters or runtime installation because Go is compiled to binary and is executed directly. Second, Go provides great standard library which is enough to create almost any applications. Third, and the most important, Go is concurrency-oriented programming language which based on goroutines and channels. In simple words, concurrency does not need to wait until function will be completed in order to move to the next tasks i.e. concurrency is not doing multiple things simultaneously as in Java, for example.
##Goal
The main purpose of the project is to highlight all the facets of the programming language Go, compare with other languages such as Java or C# and contrast in sense of code writing complexity. In addition, another part of the project is to provide examples to demonstrate the performance of Go versus the other languages by using algorithms.
##Languages
Programming languages that are used in the project:
*Go; 
*Java; 
*C#.
